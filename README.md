# BoxTurtleMC: BoxTurtle Motor Controller
This is a self sourced DC motor controller for use with [Klipper](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtleg) and the  [BoxTurtle](https://klipper3d.org) project. This is not an official [Armored Turtle](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle) project.

![BT_Render](images/MC-Render.png)

The main focus is combining this project with a [BigTreeTech MMB](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-mmb). This will enable full BoxTurtle control of the DC motor powered re-spoolers. It also allows a nice upgrade path from a ERCF to the BoxTurtle. It includes additional support for the "BoxTurtle Lane Controls" mod and [Project TurtleScreen](https://github.com/sbtoonz/TurtleScreen). This board will also have the option of controlling up to 8 re-spooler motors so it should be useful in larger custom BoxTurtle setups with more than 4 lanes. 

The board was developed in the free version of [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/). So it can be downloaded and modified.

Note there is a mount for the board in the stl folder.

## Making a PCB
![BT_Render](images/PCB_Editor.png) 

Download the latest zip files from the gerber folder. This file can then be submitted to one of the PCB manufactures online like [PCBWay.com](https://www.pcbway.com/), [HQ NextPCB](https://www.nextpcb.com/), [ALLPCB](https://www.allpcb.com/) or [JLCPcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/). Orders are usually a minimum of 5 PCBs per order and should be around $30 USD for 5 boards including shipping. If this is your first time doing this there are often "first time customer" discounts that can push the cost below $20 including shipping. I suggest shopping around to find the best deal. 

Ideally those who go through the process to make circuit boards will make their extra boards available to others at a minimum cost. 

## BOM
All parts are available on Amazon with the exception of the 2 CANBUS plugs.
Those are available at [DigiKey.com](https://DigiKey.com).  

- 1 PCB.
- 1 Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico2.
- 1 [1N5817 Diode](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1N5817+Diode). Required.
- 1 [MP1583EN DC-DC buck converter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=MP1583EN+dc-dc+5v+buck+converter). Required. A fixed 5V module is STRONGLY suggested to avoid issues adjusting a variable voltage version.
- 1 [CJMCU-1051](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=CJMCU-1051) module for CANBUS connectivity. Required.
- 1-4 [DRV8833 DC Motor Driver Controller Board 1.5A Dual H Bridge](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=DRV8833+DC+Motor+Driver+Controller+Board+3A+Dual+H+Bridge) modules.
	1 to 4 as needed. Each provides control for 2 motors each. So if you want to control 4 lanes you will need 2 DRV8833 modules. 
- [2.54mm female pin headers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=2.54mm+Female+Pin+Header) are optional, but strongly suggested. This allows swapping out components if there is an issue.
	+ 2 2.54mm 20 pin socket connectors for Pi Pico
	+ 1 2.54mm 8 pin socket connectors for CJMCU-1051
	+ 2 2.54mm 6 pin socket connectors for each DRV8833 module.
- 2 [Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 43045](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0430450414/252509) connector header. Available from DigiKey.com.
- 2 or more [JST XH 2.54mm 2-pin female sockets](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=JST-XH+2.54mm+2pin+female+sockets). This depends on what parts of the board you will make use of.

The following 2 items are only needed if this board will be the last device in a CANBUS chain. 
- 1 through hole 120 Ohm axial resister. 
- 1 2pin [2.54mm Pitch Single Row Pin Header](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=2.54mm+Pitch+Single+Row+Pin+Header). A jumper will also be needed for this pin header. 

If you need to terminate this board use the CAN2 connector for the incoming CANBUS connection. Do not use the CAN1 connection when terminated. 

Note when ordering the Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connector headers you may also want to order some [Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 plugs](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0430250408/4481508) along with the appropriate pins [Molex 0430300007](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0430300007/252479). Since DigiKey allows ordering in specified quantities as low as 1 this may also be a good place to source the needed diode and optional resister.

## Tools Needed
- Basic experience soldering components.
- Soldering iron with fine tip.
- Good solder. Thinner is better.

## Assembling PCB

Solder on the 2 CANBUS plugs and the MP1583EN module. It is recommended that the MP1583EN be soldered to the board and not socketed. If you didn't get a fixed 5V MP1583EN then make sure to set it to 5V. You can do this by connecting the board to a CANBUS connection and adjusting the potentiometer on the MP1583EN while monitoring the output voltage via the 5V connector with a multi meter. Note a fixed 5V MP1583EN is suggested to bypass this step and avoid issues.

Solder in the 1N5817 diode. Note if you are soldering the Pico to the board (not recommended) the diode will need to be installed on the back of the circuit board.

Next solder on the socket connectors as needed. It is recommended to socket the Pico and the DRV8833 modules. The DRV8833 modules are sensitive to static shock. So this makes them easy to replace if needed. 

CANBUS terminator if needed.

## Flashing Katapult and Klipper

CANBUS needs to already setup on your printer. The [Esotericalâ€™s guide](https://canbus.esoterical.online/) is a great resource.

First step is to put katapult on the Pi Pico. If katapult isn't already on your klipper host follow the instructions from the katapult website to install it on your klipper host. Instructions are available at [https://github.com/Arksine/katapult](https://github.com/Arksine/katapult). 

Configure katapult as shown below.

![BT_Render](images/katapult.png) 

Note if you are using a Pi Pico2 change the "Processor Model" to rp2350.

After configuring and making katapult. Connect your Pi Pico while pressing the boot button on the Pico via USB to your klipper host. 

Then at the hosts command line type lsusb. The Pico should be listed as "Raspberry Pi RP2040 Boot" or "Raspberry Pi RP2350 Boot" if it's a Pico2. Make a note of the Pico's address. It should be something like "2e8a:000f". 

```
~/katapult $ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 2109:0817 VIA Labs, Inc. USB3.0 Hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 0eef:0005 D-WAV Scientific Co., Ltd WS170120
Bus 001 Device 009: ID 1d50:614e OpenMoko, Inc. rp2040
Bus 001 Device 012: ID 2e8a:000f Raspberry Pi RP2350 Boot
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 1d50:606f OpenMoko, Inc. Geschwister Schneider CAN adapter
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2109:3431 VIA Labs, Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

Now flash the Pico using the following command `sudo make flash device=2e8a:000f` substituting the address of your Pico while in the katapult directory.

```
~/katapult $ sudo make flash device=2e8a:000f
Flashing out/katapult.uf2
Loaded UF2 image with 29 pages
Found rp2040 device on USB bus 1 address 11
Flashing...
Resetting interface
Locking
Exiting XIP mode
Erasing
Flashing
Rebooting device
```

Connect the board to your CANBUS. Make sure to power off everything before doing that and the bring everything back up.

Check if the Pico is detected on the CANBUS with the command:

```
~/klipper $ ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
Found canbus_uuid=05a32df28477, Application: Klipper
Total 1 uuids found
```

If the Pico isn't found then something went wrong in the process.

Record the UUID given for the Pico. You will need this to flash klipper and to configure klipper.

Reconnect to the command line on your klipper host. Next change to the klipper directory. There run the command `make menuconfig` and change the settings as shown below.

![BT_Render](images/klipper.png) 

Note if you are using a Pi Pico2 change the "Processor Model" to rp2350.

Make klipper then flash it to the Pico with the command below. Substitute the uuid (XXXXXXXXXXXX) with your Pico's uuid you recorded above.

```
cd ~/katapult/scripts && python3 flashtool.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

If all is well the Pico will reboot and there should be a green light on the Pi Pico and a red light on each DRV8833. If the Pico light does not come on power off and back on. If it still does not come on something went wrong along the way. 

## Klipper configuration

Copy the `MC_1.cfg` in the klipper folder to your klipper configurations folder. 

Then add

```
[include MC_1.cfg]
```

to your `printer.cfg`. Make sure this is before you load the [AFC-Klipper-Add-On](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On/tree/main) cfg files. 

Note that with the DRV8833 modules use one line controls the SLEEP/ENABLE option for 2 motors. So rather than a MOT1_EN alias the BoxTurtleMC has a MOT12_EN alias that is the ENABLE function for both motor 1 and motor 2.

This then requires setting a `[duplicate_pin_override]` section in your klipper configuration. See the example near the end of the `MC_1.cfg` file for an example. Note that if you don't have a `[duplicate_pin_override]` section in your current configuration you can uncomment the section in the `MC_1.cfg` file.

If you are combining the BoxTurtleMC with BTT MMB you will need to edit the AFC/mcu/MMB_1.0.cfg or MMB_1.1.cfg and remove or comment out the MOT lines by placing a # in front of each line.

```
	#MOT1_RWD=PA0	, 
	#MOT2_RWD=PA1	, 
	#MOT3_RWD=PB10	, 
	#MOT4_RWD=PB2	,
```

Then you need to change the "afc_motor" entries in your `AFC/AFC_Turtle_1.cfg` file for each lane that you want the re-spooler motors controlled by the BoxTurtleMC. For example change

```
afc_motor_rwd: Turtle_1:MOT1_RWD
afc_motor_fwd: Turtle_1:MOT1_FWD
afc_motor_enb: Turtle_1:MOT1_EN
```

to

```
afc_motor_rwd: MC_1:MOT1_RWD
afc_motor_fwd: MC_1:MOT1_FWD
afc_motor_enb: MC_1:MOT12_EN
```

You will need to do this for each lane that you want the BoxTurtleMC to control the DC motor in the re-spooler. 

Use the [AFC Klipper Add-on](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On/)'s "TEST lane=lane1" to check motor control is setup properly. 

## Options
- Only purchasing the components you need. All locations on the board do not need to be populated. You can choose and select the ones you want to populate based on your intended usage. Below is a board setup to only use motors 1-4.

![BT_Render](images/PXL_20250323_005901771.jpg)

- Using USB rather than CANBUS. Theoretically this board could be used by klipper through the USB connector on the Pi Pico. The CJMCU-1051 could then be excluded, but the board would still need external power for the DRV8833s. This would require changing the katapult and klipper configurations. So it's only recommended for experienced klipper users. 

- A question was asked about using a cheap Ender 3 SKR MCU with this board. Most of those boards only have 4 switches (X, Y, Z limit plus filament detection) and 11 switches are needed for the BoxTurtle. The board already has 6 switches but was missing one additional switch to give the needed 11 switches. Two pins from the DRV3 socket can be used for an additional switch. GND and IN3. See the image below. This would make GPIO12 switch #7 on the board. NOTE THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED, but should work.

![BT_Render](images/SW7.png)

## Early release 1.0 boards
Note the 1.0 board does have a known issue. The CANL and CANH pins are reversed. Still works, but where katapult and klipper want to use pins 4 and 5 as defaults you have to switch them to 5 then 4. Version 1.1 board fixes this. See the screenshots in the "Flashing Katapult and Klipper" section above.
