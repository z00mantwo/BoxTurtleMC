# BoxTurtleMC: BoxTurtle Motor Controller
This is a self sourced DC motor controller for use with [Klipper](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtleg) and the  [BoxTurtle](https://klipper3d.org) project. 

![BT_Render](images/MC-Render.png)

The main focus is combining this project with a BigTreeTech MMB. This to enable full BoxTurtle control of the DC motor powered re-spoolers. It also adds additional support for the "BoxTurtle Lane Controls" mod and [Project TurtleScreen](https://github.com/sbtoonz/TurtleScreen). This board will also have the option of controlling up to 8 re-spooler motors so it should be useful in larger custom BoxTurtle setups with more than 4 lanes. 

## Making a PCB
![BT_Render](images/PCB_Editor.png) 

Download the latest zip files from the gerber folder. This file can then be submitted to one of the PCB manufactures online like [PCBWay.com](https://www.pcbway.com/) or [JLCPcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/). Orders are usually a minimum of 5 PCBs per order and should be around $30 USD including shipping.

Ideally those who go through the process to make circuit boards will make their extra boards available to others at a minimum cost. 

## BOM
All parts are available on Amazon with the exception of the 2 CANBUS plugs.
Those are available at [DigiKey.com](https://DigiKey.com).  

- 1 PCB.
- 1 Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico2.
- 1 [1N5817 Diode](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1N5817+Diode).
- 1 through hole 120 Ohm axial resister.

- [2.54mm female pin headers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=2.54mm+Female+Pin+Header) are optional, but strongly suggested. This allows swapping out components if there is an issue.
	+ 2 2.54mm 20 pin socket connectors for Pi Pico
	+ 1 2.54mm 8 pin socket connectors for CJMCU-1051
	+ 2 2.54mm 6 pin socket connectors for each DRV8833 module.
- 2 [Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 43045](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0430450414/252509) connectors. Available from DigiKey.com.
- 2 or more [JST XH 2.54mm 2-pin female sockets](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=JST-XH+2.54mm+2pin+female+sockets). This depends on what parts of the board you will make use of.

## Tools Needed
- Basic experience soldering components
- Soldering iron with fine tip
- Good solder. 

## Assembling PCB

Solder on the 2 CANBUS plugs and the MP1583EN module. If you didn't get a fixed 5V MP1583EN then make sure to set it to 5V. You can do this by connecting the board to a CANBUS connection and adjusting the potentiometer on the MP1583EN while monitoring the output voltage via the 5V connector. Note a fixed 5V MP1583EN is suggested to bypass this step.

Next solder on the socket connectors as needed.

Solder on the 1N5817 diode. If you are not using socket connectors for the Pi Pico you can place the diode on the back of the  board. 

CANBUS terminator if needed.

## Katapult and Klipper configuration

CANBUS needs to already setup on your printer. The [Esotericalâ€™s guide](https://canbus.esoterical.online/) is a great resource.

First step is to put katapult on the Pi Pico. If katapult isn't already on your klipper host follow the instructions from the katapult website to install it on your klipper host. Instructions are available at [https://github.com/Arksine/katapult](https://github.com/Arksine/katapult). 

Configure katapult as shown below.

![BT_Render](images/katapult.png) 

Note if you are using a Pi Pico2 change the "Processor Model" to rp2350.

After configuring and making katapult. Connect your Pi Pico while pressing the boot button on the Pico via USB to your klipper host. 

Then at the hosts command line type lsusb. The Pico should be listed as "Raspberry Pi RP2040 Boot" or "Raspberry Pi RP2350 Boot" if it's a Pico2. Make a note of the Pico's address. It should be something like "2e8a:000f". 

```
~/katapult $ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 2109:0817 VIA Labs, Inc. USB3.0 Hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 0eef:0005 D-WAV Scientific Co., Ltd WS170120
Bus 001 Device 009: ID 1d50:614e OpenMoko, Inc. rp2040
Bus 001 Device 012: ID 2e8a:000f Raspberry Pi RP2350 Boot
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 1d50:606f OpenMoko, Inc. Geschwister Schneider CAN adapter
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2109:3431 VIA Labs, Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

Now flash the Pico using the following command `sudo make flash device=2e8a:000f` substituting the address of your Pico while in the katapult directory.

```
~/katapult $ sudo make flash device=2e8a:000f
Flashing out/katapult.uf2

Found rp2040 device on USB bus 1 address 11
Flashing...
Resetting interface
Locking
Exiting XIP mode

Rebooting device
```

Connect the board to your CANBUS. Make sure to power off everything before doing that and the bring everything back up.

Check if the Pico is detected on the CANBUS with the command:

```
~/klipper $ ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
Found canbus_uuid=05a32df28477, Application: Klipper
Total 1 uuids found
```

If the Pico isn't found then something went wrong in the process.

Record the UUID given for the Pico. You will need this to flash klipper and to configure klipper.

Reconnect to the command line on your klipper host. Next change to the klipper directory. There run the command `make menuconfig` and change the settings as shown below.

Note if you are using a Pi Pico2 change the "Processor Model" to rp2350.


********************* END OF COMPLETED DOCS *********************
 
********************* Work in progress below this point *********

Make klipper

Flash klipper 

If all is well there should be a green light on the Pi Pico and a red light on each DRV8833. 

## Options

- USB rather than CANBUS

## Early release 1.0 boards
Note the 1.0 board does have a known issue. The CANL and CANH pins are reversed. Still works, but where katapult and klipper want to use pins 4 and 5 as defaults you have to switch them to 5 then 4. Version 1.1 board fixes this.
